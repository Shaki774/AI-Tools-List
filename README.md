## 📊 Data Analysis & Visualizations

We’ve just added **detailed analytics** on our AI tools dataset! See [DataAnalysis.md](./DataAnalysis.md) for:

- **Pricing Distribution**  
  Bar charts showing how many tools fall into each monthly pricing bracket (Free, 0–2 USD, …, 48–50 USD, 50+ USD).  
- **Traffic Source Breakdown**  
  Pie charts illustrating Direct, Search, and Referral traffic shares across five visitor-volume tiers.

These visualizations surface key insights—like the dominance of freemium models and the shift from Search to Direct traffic as tools gain popularity.
